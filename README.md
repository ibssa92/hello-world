Hello everyone,

I am having so much fun learning about git and github
Go Seahawks!

  * What is github? GitHub is a distributed version-control platform where users can store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.

   * How is git different than github? Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.

  *  What is a branch? branches allow you to make changes to your code without committing them

  * What does merging a branch do? allows you to commit the changes you made

  * What is a pull request? proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.
